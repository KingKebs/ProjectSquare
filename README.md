Here's a summary of the role of each file in the backend of your Project Square app:

1. **app.js**:
   - The main entry point for your Node.js application.
   - Configures and initializes your Express.js server.
   - Sets up routes, middleware, and other server-related configurations.

2. **config/database.js**:
   - Contains the configuration for connecting to your chosen database (e.g., MongoDB).
   - Establishes a connection to the database using Mongoose or a similar library.

3. **models/Brand.js**:
   - Defines the data schema and structure for the "Brand" model.
   - Specifies how data is stored in the database, including fields and their types.

4. **routes/api.js**:
   - Defines the API routes for your application.
   - Handles requests and responses for routes related to brands and other data.
   - Retrieves data from the database and sends it as a response to clients.

These files collectively set up the backend infrastructure for your Project Square app. `app.js` is the entry point that configures the server, `database.js` connects to the database, `Brand.js` defines the data structure, and `api.js` handles API routes, data retrieval, and responses. This separation of concerns helps organize and manage your backend code effectively.
